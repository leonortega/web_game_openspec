## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Player can take damage and recover through respawn
The game SHALL track player health or hit state, apply damage from enemies and hazards, and return the player to active play through death and respawn rules. When the player collides with a damaging enemy or hazard while one or more active non-invincible powers are present and invincibility is not active, the game MUST clear those active non-invincible powers and MUST NOT reduce health for that hit. When invincibility is active, damaging contact MUST preserve invincibility until its timer expires, MUST keep health unchanged for that hit, and MUST still clear any other active non-invincible powers. When the player has no active powers, damaging contact MUST reduce health as normal. When the player reaches the defeat condition, the game MUST enter a short non-controllable death presentation state that emits a bounded blow-apart particle burst from the player's last position before respawning at the most recently activated checkpoint or level start. That defeat presentation MUST stay local, deterministic, and short enough to preserve the current respawn flow, it MUST remain visually distinct from stomp and Plasma Blaster enemy-defeat bursts, and it MUST NOT change damage immunity rules, checkpoint semantics, or which respawn point is selected.

#### Scenario: Taking damage from a threat while unpowered
- **WHEN** the player collides with a damaging enemy or hazard and has no active powers
- **THEN** the game applies damage or loss of health to the player

#### Scenario: Consuming non-invincible powers on a protected hit
- **WHEN** the player collides with a damaging enemy or hazard while active non-invincible powers are present and invincibility is not active
- **THEN** the game clears those active non-invincible powers and does not remove health for that hit

#### Scenario: Retaining invincibility on damaging contact
- **WHEN** the player collides with a damaging enemy or hazard while invincibility is active
- **THEN** the game keeps invincibility active for its remaining timer and does not remove health for that hit

#### Scenario: Clearing other powers while invincible
- **WHEN** the player collides with a damaging enemy or hazard while invincibility and another active power are both present
- **THEN** the game preserves invincibility and clears the other active power states for that hit

#### Scenario: Losing all health
- **WHEN** the player reaches the defeat condition
- **THEN** the game triggers a death state, plays the bounded blow-apart defeat presentation, and then restarts the player from the current respawn point

#### Scenario: Distinguishing player defeat from enemy defeat
- **WHEN** the player sees a player death and an enemy defeat during active play
- **THEN** the player-death presentation remains visually distinct from stomp and Plasma Blaster enemy-defeat feedback
- **AND** the underlying respawn selection and timing stay unchanged

#### Scenario: Respawning from a checkpoint
- **WHEN** the player has activated a checkpoint before dying
- **THEN** the player respawns at that checkpoint instead of the stage start

#### Scenario: Losing powers after death
- **WHEN** the player dies after taking damage
- **THEN** the game clears the player's active powers
