## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Stages have a clear start-to-exit completion flow
The game SHALL organize play into discrete stages with a defined start position, traversable route, intermediate gameplay segments, and completion exit. A stage MUST begin with a short pre-play presentation step before active control starts, and completion MUST flow through a readable stage-clear results step before continuing. A stage MUST only be marked complete when the player reaches the exit in a valid active state, and the route to that exit MUST support sustained progression across a long-form stage structure.

#### Scenario: Beginning a stage
- **WHEN** the player enters a level
- **THEN** the game shows a short stage presentation before gameplay begins in an active state

#### Scenario: Advancing through a long stage
- **WHEN** the player moves from one major stage segment to the next
- **THEN** the game preserves a clear sense of forward progress toward the exit

#### Scenario: Reaching the exit
- **WHEN** the player reaches the stage exit while alive
- **THEN** the stage is marked complete and the stage-clear flow begins

### Requirement: Stage completion unlocks forward progression
The game SHALL unlock the next stage in the MVP sequence after the current stage is completed, and the normal non-final completion flow SHALL continue automatically toward that next stage after the stage-clear results screen.

#### Scenario: Completing an early stage
- **WHEN** the player completes a stage that is not the final stage in the MVP sequence
- **THEN** the next stage becomes available and the game continues automatically after the results screen

#### Scenario: Returning after prior completion
- **WHEN** the player returns to the stage selection flow after completing a stage
- **THEN** previously unlocked stages remain available
